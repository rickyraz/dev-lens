# ðŸŽ¯ DevLens
DevLens is a **real-time accessibility** developer tool that brings visual overlays to accessibility testing. Built with **Effect-TS** for maximum type safety and performance, DevLens helps developers catch accessibility issues as they code, not after they ship.

Previously, accessibility tools:

- **WAVE** can feel disconnected from development workflow
- **axe DevTools** lacked simple visual cues in real-time

DevLens attempts to solve these problems:

- It requires no code changes â€“ just drop it in
- It highlights exactly the elements you need to fix
- No more switching between tools when debugging
- Always accessible through a toolbar on page

Unlike traditional accessibility tools that run post-development audits, DevLens integrates directly into your development workflow, providing instant visual feedback with smart overlays that highlight accessibility issues in real-time.
