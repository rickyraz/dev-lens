> **Real-time accessibility scanning with visual developer experience**

DevLens is a **real-time accessibility developer tool** that brings visual overlays to accessibility testing. Built with **Effect-TS** and powered by **Lynce engine** for maximum type safety and performance, DevLens helps developers catch accessibility issues **as they code**, not after they ship.

Previously, accessibility tools:
- **WAVE** can feel disconnected from development workflow  
- **axe DevTools** lacked simple visual cues in real-time
- **Lighthouse** only provides post-build analysis

DevLens attempts to solve these problems:
- It requires **no code changes** â€“ just drop it in
- It highlights **exactly the elements** you need to fix  
- **No more switching** between tools when debugging
- Always accessible through a **non-intrusive overlay**
- **Framework-aware** analysis for React/Solid/Vue/Angular

Unlike traditional accessibility tools that run post-development audits, DevLens integrates directly into your development workflow, providing **instant visual feedback** with smart overlays that highlight accessibility issues in real-time.
